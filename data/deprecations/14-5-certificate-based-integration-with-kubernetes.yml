    The certificate-based integration with Kubernetes [will be deprecated and removed](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/11/15/deprecating-the-cert-based-kubernetes-integration/).

    For GitLab Self-Managed, we are introducing the [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/feature_flags/#enable-or-disable-the-feature) `certificate_based_clusters` in GitLab 15.0 so you can keep your certificate-based integration enabled. However, the feature flag will be disabled by default, so this change is a **breaking change**.

    For a more robust, secure, forthcoming, and reliable integration with Kubernetes, use the
    [agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/clusters/agent/) to connect Kubernetes clusters with GitLab.
    For information about this migration, see [migrate to agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/infrastructure/clusters/migrate_to_gitlab_agent/).

    GitLab will not remove this feature until the new solution has feature parity.
    For more information about the blockers to removal, see [issue 199](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/199).

    For updates and details about this deprecation, see [epic 8](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/configure/-/epics/8).
