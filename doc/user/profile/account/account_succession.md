You can grant individuals permission to access your GitLab account if you are unable to manage it
yourself. This ensures continuity of your work and projects.

## Account manager

A designated account manager can temporarily manage your GitLab account if you are unable to do so.
Account managers are commonly used in situations where you are legally or medically incapacitated,
or on a work sabbatical. The account manager can temporarily obtain full access to your account. All
activity performed during this time is associated with your username and user ID, and any commits or
comments display your username.
