Foundational agents are specialized AI assistants that extend the capabilities of GitLab Duo Chat
with domain-specific expertise and context awareness.

Unlike the general-purpose GitLab Duo agent, foundational agents understand the unique workflows,
frameworks, and best practices of their specialized domains. Each agent combines deep knowledge of
GitLab features with role-specific reasoning to provide targeted help that aligns with how
practitioners actually work.

When you interact with a foundational agent, you're engaging with an AI tool that understands not just
what you're asking, but the broader context of your role and objectives. For example:

- A product planning agent that understands prioritization frameworks and dependency management.
- A security agent that recognizes vulnerability patterns and compliance requirements.

These agents integrate into your existing GitLab workflows through Chat,
and can help provide specialized support without requiring you to leave your current context.

GitLab provides foundational agents for workflows where specialized knowledge significantly improves
outcome quality. Each agent maintains awareness of GitLab-specific implementations, organizational
standards, and industry best practices in its domain. This specialization helps enable more accurate,
actionable, and contextually appropriate responses compared to general-purpose AI help.

## Available foundational agents

The following foundational agents are available in GitLab 18.5:

- [GitLab Duo Planner](planner.md), for product management and
  planning workflows.
