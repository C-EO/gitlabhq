title: Ona

{{< details >}}

- Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
- Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed

{{< /details >}}

With [Ona](https://ona.com/) (formerly Gitpod), you can describe your development environment as code to get fully
set up, compiled, and tested development environments for any GitLab project. The development
environments are not only automated but also prebuilt which means that Ona continuously builds
your Git branches like a CI/CD server.

This means you don't have to wait for dependencies to download and builds to start
coding immediately. With Ona you can start coding instantly on any project, branch, and merge
request from your browser.

To use the GitLab Ona integration, you must enable it for your GitLab instance and in your preferences. Users of:

- GitLab.com can use it immediately after it's [enabled in their user preferences](#enable-ona-in-your-user-preferences).
- GitLab Self-Managed instances can use it after:
  1. It's [enabled and configured by a GitLab administrator](#configure-a-gitlab-self-managed-instance).
  1. It's [enabled in their user settings](#enable-ona-in-your-user-preferences).

For more information about Ona, see the Ona [features](https://ona.com/) and
[documentation](https://ona.com/docs).

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
